## Project 2: London House Price Prediction Model
#### Task: Build a machine learning model where users can receive an estimate on future price changes to their property
###### [Software used: SQL | Python | Excel | Tableau]
###### Built a graphical user interface where users can receive an estimate on future price changes of their property.This is done by the user entering key values such as postcode, quality of local schools, availability of off road parking and type of property.Estimates are calculated by using machine learning models to predict the future value of a property based on past data from HM Land Registry which includes information such as type of property, location, and availability of off road parking, as well as using data from the wider economy such as new dwellings completed each year and the rate of inflation. When testing the model, it achieved an average absolute error of Â£117k or 16%

## Project 3: Competitor price movements analysis

###### [Software used: SQL | SAS | Google sheets]
###### Analysing everything relating to competitor price changes from when they make changes, how much prices change by on average, to which categories see the most changes.

## Project 4: Data analysis and visualisation of Covid-19 data
#### Task: Determine how much of an effect does the covid-19 vaccination have on death and serious illness? How much do these effects differ in terms of age demographic and gender?
###### [Software used: Tableau, Excel, Powerpoint]
###### For this task I collected data relating to covid-19 from gov.uk. I then went about exploring the effectivness of the vaccine by comparing two periods: 'Sept-Nov 2020' and 'Sept-Nov 2021'. I chose these two periods as I wanted two sample periods which were as homogeneous as possible with the only significant difference being that by Sept 2021 over 80% of the over 70's were vaccinated.
